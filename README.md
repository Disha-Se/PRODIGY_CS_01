# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool

This is a simple Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts a given message by shifting each letter by a specified number.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts a given message by shifting each letter back by a specified number.
- **User-friendly**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher
